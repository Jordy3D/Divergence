Got bored, have divergence.

The worldline is calculated the following way:
1. Get current IP address
2. Split it into 4 parts, padded with 0s to 3 digits each
3. Rejoin the parts into a single string
4. Get every odd and even character from the string and add the resulting strings together
5. Get the current time in epoch seconds, trimmed to 6 digits
6. Add the two strings together, with slight randomization

Spat this out in like an hour or something, off and on.  
Quality was not on the forefront of my mind.
